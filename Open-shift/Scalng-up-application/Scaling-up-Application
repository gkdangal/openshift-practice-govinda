1.Login to master node
2. Under the dev project, launch a new application with the ruby-22-centos7 image, using the following template: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git
3. Watch the build progress until it completes. 
4. Once build completes, scale the app up to 3 pods. Once again, observe the build until it completes.

login to master node
 

ssh root@[MASTER_IP]

 

create new app under dev project with ruby-22-centos7 image
 

oc project dev

oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

 

 

Observe build progress
 

watch oc get builds

 

 

scale app up to 3 pods
 

oc scale --replicas=3 dc ruby-ex

 

verify scaling is complete
 

oc get pods

 

expected output:

 

NAME              READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

ruby-ex-1-1ppls   1/1       Running     0          24s

ruby-ex-1-3q95z   1/1       Running     0          6m

ruby-ex-1-4hqft   1/1       Running     0          24s

ruby-ex-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          7m

 

This completes the exercise.
