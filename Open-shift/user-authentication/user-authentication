In this lab, we will practice configuring basic authentication using the htpasswd utility.

Log in to the master node.
If not already installed, install the httpd-tools package.
Once the install completes, edit the master-config file to enable authentication using HTPasswd with credentials stored in /etc/origin/openshift-passwd. Save and close the file.
Create the credential file under /etc/origin/openshift-passwd.
Once the file is created, add a user with the name student and the password openshift using the htpasswd utility.
Assure that the cluster recognizes the new user.
Verify login either using the OC command-line client or by logging into the OpenShift web console as the newly-created student user.
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Log in to the master node. From Testing hosts
$ ssh root@masterIP
2. If not already installed, install the httpd-tools package
# yum -y install httpd-tool
3 Once the install completes, edit the master-config file to enable authentication using HTPasswd with credentials stored in /etc/origin/openshift-passwd. Save and close the file.
On master node, under the oauthConfig section in file /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml, replace the value kind: DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider with kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider, being mindful of indentation.
------------
# vim /etc/origin/master/master-config.yam
oauthConfig:
name: deny_all
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider

Being mindful of indentation, create a new file attribute either directly above OR directly below the previously edited kind attribute, pointing to /etc/origin/openshift-passwd, which is the file that will contain OpenShift authentication info.
-------------------------------
4. Create the credential file under /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
# touch /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
--------------------------
5. # vim /etc/origin/master/master-config.yam
oauthConfig:
name: deny_all
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
6. Once the file is created, add a user with the name student and the password openshift using the htpasswd utility.
# htpasswd -b /etc/origin/openshift-passwd student redhat123
here student=> username
     redhat123=> password for student user
---------------------------------------------------
7. Assure that the cluster recognizes the new user.
On the master node, restart the atomic-openshift-master service:

# systemctl restart automic-openshift-master.service
---------------------------------------------------
Verify login either using the OC command-line client or by logging into the OpenShift web console as the newly-created student user.

Open a web browser window and navigate to https://master.example.com:8443. Since the master host uses a self-signed certificate, you will need to manually add an acception for your hostname in your browser settings. 

Once the exception is added, you should be forwarded to the OpenShift Container Platform login page. Enter username student and password openshift.

Once logged in, you should be presented with a "Welcome to OpenShift" greeting.
