1. on this page i am going to implement how to secure the web page by terminal editing the route
$ ssh -i <private key file> root@master-ip
--------------
# oc whoami
-----
# oc new-project secure
# oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos-https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git
------
exposing services
# oc expose srv ruby-ex
------------------
# oc get route > to view the route

---------------
To edit the route
# oc edit route ruby-ex
Go to spec section
at host line

host: ruby-ex-secure-ocp.master.example.com
#add below host line
tls:
 termination:edge
Save and exit
-------------------
# oc get route ruby-ex

Now we will get webe page if you type https on your brouser
